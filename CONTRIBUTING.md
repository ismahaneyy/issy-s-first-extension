# Contributing to Issy Blog Extension

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Issy Blog Extension! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated.

### Types of Contributions

- **Bug Fixes** - Help us squash bugs and improve stability
- **New Features** - Add functionality that enhances the user experience
- **Documentation** - Improve README, code comments, or API documentation
- **Tests** - Add or improve test coverage
- **Code Quality** - Refactor code, improve performance, or fix linting issues

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** 18.0.0 or higher
- **VS Code** 1.103.0 or higher
- **Git** for version control
- **npm** 8.0.0 or higher

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/issy-s-first-extension.git
   cd issy-s-first-extension
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   # Run linting
   npm run lint
   
   # Run tests
   npm test
   
   # Launch extension in development mode
   F5
   ```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

Always work on a feature branch, never directly on `main`:

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

Follow these guidelines while coding:

#### Code Style Guidelines

- **JavaScript Standards**: Follow ES2022 standards
- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line Length**: Keep lines under 100 characters
- **Naming**: Use descriptive variable and function names
- **Comments**: Add JSDoc comments for public functions

#### VS Code Extension Best Practices

- **Error Handling**: Always include try-catch blocks for async operations
- **User Feedback**: Provide clear error messages and loading indicators
- **Performance**: Minimize API calls and optimize data processing
- **Accessibility**: Ensure extensions work with screen readers

#### Example Code Structure

```javascript
/**
 * Fetches articles from RSS feed with error handling
 * @param {string} url - RSS feed URL
 * @returns {Promise<Array>} Array of parsed articles
 */
async function fetchArticles(url) {
    try {
        const response = await axios.get(url);
        return parseRssFeed(response.data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to fetch articles:', error);
        throw new Error('Unable to fetch articles. Please try again.');
    }
}
```

### 3. Testing Your Changes

Before submitting, ensure your changes work correctly:

```bash
# Run linting to check code quality
npm run lint

# Run tests to ensure nothing is broken
npm test

# Test the extension manually
F5  # Launch Extension Development Host
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Use conventional commit messages:

```bash
# Format: type(scope): description
git commit -m "feat(api): add caching for RSS feed requests"
git commit -m "fix(ui): resolve QuickPick menu display issue"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:

- **Clear title** describing the change
- **Detailed description** of what was changed and why
- **Screenshots** if UI changes were made
- **Test results** showing everything passes
